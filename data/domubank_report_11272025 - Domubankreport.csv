May I speak to Derek Dixon?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Thanks, Derek. This is Jamie from Domu Acceptance. I'm calling about your vehicle payment for your account with us, Just so you know, this is an attempt to collect a debt by a debt collector. Any information obtained will be used for that purpose. Right now, your payment for your vehicle is past due. The total amount due is 498 dollars and 69 cents, Let's get this taken care of. You pay the full amount today?\nUser: No.\nAI: Okay. I understand. Can you pay the full amount of 498 dollars and 9 cents within the next 5 days?\nUser: I don't know yet. Maybe.\nAI: Alright. If paying the full amount in the next 5 days is possible, that would bring your account current. And stop any further collection activity. Is there a specific reason you're unsure, or do you need a little more time to decide?\nUser: More time.\nAI: I get it. If you need more time, we can look at a partial payment option. How much could you pay toward your account in the next 5 days?\nUser: Like, 2. 2 2 50.\nAI: So you're able to pay 2 and 50 dollars within the next 5 days. That would help. But to set up a partial payment, it needs to cover at least the late charge and extension fee, Can you increase that amount at all, maybe closer to the full balance?\nUser: Of how much?\nAI: The full balance due right now is 498 dollars and 69 cents. If you can't pay that, the next best option is to pay as much as possible. Ideally enough to cover late charge and extension fee. How much can you realistically pay within the next 5 days?\nUser: Don't know yet.\nAI: Alright. If you're not sure yet, that's okay. You tell me what's making it hard to make a payment right now?\nUser: Behind 1. Behind on deals.\nAI: I understand things can get tough when you're behind. Would you like to talk to a live agent who can go over more options and maybe help find a solution?\nUser: No.\nAI: Okay. No problem. If anything changes or you decide you're able to make a payment, you can always reach us at 809 10 8 1 8 0. Is there anything else I can help you with about your payment today?\nUser: No.\nAI: Alright. Thanks for your time, Derek. If you have questions or want to make a payment later, just give us a call. Have a good day.\nUser: Alright. Thank you.\nAI: You're welcome. Take care.\n","Jamie (Domu Acceptance) called Derek Dixon about a past-due vehicle payment of $498.69.
